#The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user.
#The user needs to guess what that number is.
#If the userâ€™s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong.
#(e.g. The number is too high or too low).
#If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear.
#Youâ€™ll need functions to check if the user input is an actual number,
#to see the difference between the inputted number and the randomly generated numbers, and to then compare the numbers.
